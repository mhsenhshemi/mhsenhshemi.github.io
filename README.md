## NOW
I am a language researcher interested in both (systemic) functional linguistics and natural language processing. I am currently working at the Terminology Department of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature, [APLL](https://apll.ir/).

## BEFORE
I worked as a Terminology Expert at the [RCTS](https://apll.ir/rcts/). I assumed a part-time Editor role at [Goman Publication](https://gomanbook.com/) from December 2016 onwards. Prior to these roles, I served as the COO at [Lahn-e Digar](https://www.instagram.com/lahnedigar/), overseeing various aspects of audiobook production.

## EDUCATION
Master of Arts in Terminology, [RCTS](https://apll.ir/rcts/) <br>
September 2016 - September 2020 <br>
GPA: 3.75/4.00 <br>
The curricular content within this domain closely aligns with that of Linguistics programs. Under the supervision of [Mohammad Dabir-Moghaddam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Dabir_Moghaddam/), my scholarly pursuit culminated in the completion of a Master's thesis. This thesis centered on the meticulous examination of modality and polarity systems within Persian scientific discourse, employing the analytical framework of systemic functional grammar.

Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering, [KIAU](https://karaj.iau.ir/en) <br>
September 2010 - October 2015 <br>
GPA: 2.58/4.00 <br>
My studies have covered a diverse range of topics including operations research, production planning and control, quality management, probability theory, and statistical analysis.

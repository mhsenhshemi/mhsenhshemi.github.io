## NOW
I am a language researcher interested in both (systemic) functional linguistics and natural language processing. I am currently working at the Terminology Department of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature, [APLL](https://apll.ir/).

## BEFORE
I worked as a Terminology Expert at the [RCTS](https://apll.ir/rcts/). I assumed a part-time Editor role at [Goman Publication](https://gomanbook.com/) from December 2016 onwards. Prior to these roles, I served as the COO at [Lahn-e Digar](https://www.instagram.com/lahnedigar/), overseeing various aspects of audiobook production.
